      "**External rotation of the shoulder** is primarily led by the **infraspinatus** muscle. The infraspinatus is one of the four rotator cuff muscles, and it originates from the scapula (shoulder blade) and inserts into the greater tubercle of the humerus (upper arm bone). When the infraspinatus contracts, it externally rotates the humerus, which is the movement of turning the arm outward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a **step-by-step breakdown** of how the infraspinatus muscle contributes to external rotation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Nerve stimulation**: The infraspinatus muscle receives nerve signals from the suprascapular nerve. When the suprascapular nerve is stimulated, it sends a message to the infraspinatus muscle to contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Muscle contraction**: Upon receiving the nerve signal, the infraspinatus muscle fibers shorten, generating force. This force is transmitted through the muscle's tendons to the greater tubercle of the humerus.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **External rotation**: As the infraspinatus muscle contracts, it pulls the greater tubercle of the humerus posteriorly (backward) and laterally (outward). This movement causes the humerus to rotate externally, resulting in the outward turning of the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that while the infraspinatus is the primary muscle responsible for external rotation, other muscles, such as the **teres minor** and **posterior deltoid**, can also contribute to this movement. These muscles work together to ensure smooth and coordinated external rotation of the shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this detailed explanation helps you understand the role of the infraspinatus muscle in external rotation of the shoulder. Let me know if you have any other questions! 😊\n"
