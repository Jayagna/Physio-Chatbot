      "* **Bursitis:** This is inflammation of a bursa, which is a fluid-filled sac that helps to reduce friction between bones and tendons. It can be caused by overuse, injury, or aging.\n",
      "* **Rotator cuff tear:** This is a tear in one or more of the four muscles that make up the rotator cuff, which is a group of muscles that helps to stabilize the shoulder joint. It can occur from overuse, injury, or aging.\n",
      "* **Frozen shoulder:** This is a condition in which the shoulder joint becomes stiff and painful. It can occur after an injury, surgery, or for no apparent reason.\n",
      "* **Cervical radiculopathy:** This is a condition in which a nerve in the neck becomes compressed, which can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the shoulder and arm.\n",

      "* **Rest:** Resting the shoulder can help to reduce pain and inflammation.\n",
      "* **Ice:** Applying ice to the shoulder can help to reduce pain and swelling.\n",
      "* **Heat:** Applying heat to the shoulder can help to relax muscles and relieve pain.\n",
      "* **Physical therapy:** Physical therapy can help to improve range of motion, strength, and flexibility in the shoulder.\n",
      "* **Medication:** Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help to reduce pain.\n",
      "* **Corticosteroid injections:** Corticosteroid injections can help to reduce inflammation and pain.\n",
